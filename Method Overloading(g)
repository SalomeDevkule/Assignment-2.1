Yes we can overload method with same return type however the argument list should be diffrent. 
Or aleast the sequence of the arguments should be different.
Method Overloading means to have two or more methods with same name in the same class with different arguments. 
The benefit of method overloading is that it allows you to implement methods that support the same operation 
but differ by argument number or type.
